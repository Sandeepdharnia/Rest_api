# Project Rest API

## Learning objectives
The main objective of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how REST APIs work, 
including their architecture, functionality, and implementation. 
This involves learning how to design, develop, and consume APIs that facilitate communication 
between different software systems. 
The project focuses on key concepts such as HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), endpoints, 
request and response handling, status codes, and data formats like JSON. Additionally, 
it explores how REST APIs enable seamless integration and interoperability in modern applications.

## Prepration
## Steps to Set Up the Project
  - Install Python
  - Install Django
  - Install Django REST Framework (DRF)

## Process Overview
1. Set Up Django Models
  - Define the data structure and relationships in your database.
2. Set Up Serializers
  - Convert complex data types (e.g., models) into JSON format for APIs.
3. Set Up Views
  - Create the logic to handle requests and return responses.
4. Set Up URLs
  - Map API endpoints to views for access.
5. Testing
  - Test the API endpoints for functionality and correctness using tools like Postman or Pythonâ€™s unittest.
